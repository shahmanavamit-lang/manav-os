## Project Overview
Welcome to Manav_OS, a browser-based operating system designed to visualize my trajectory as an AI & Data Science engineering student.
This project replaces the traditional static resume with an immersive, terminal-inspired experience that reflects my technical personality.

This project was built using a modern "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow. In an era where syntax is cheap but logic is expensive,
I utilized Generative AI as a force multiplier to handle syntax generation.

However, the core architecture, the creative direction, and the **11+ hours** of iterative refinement are entirely my own.

I didn't just copy-paste code; I curated it. Every animation timing, every CSS transition
and every logic gate was manually tweaked to ensure a lag-free, hyper-aesthetic experience. 

This project represents my ability to lead AI tools rather than just
consume them—focusing my effort on implementation strategy and user experience.
